こんにちは、初めまして! 私の名前はDJ Razorblade! A casual musician, turntablist, and learning programmer! I hope to collaborate and have fun with everyone!
I'm a year 11 Digital Technology and Music student from New Zealand who has been learning Python3!

### Languages~
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-%233776AB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)

### Hobbies
I work as a musician, so in my free time, I experiment with FL Studio 24, along with practicing my turntablism with Serato DJ Lite or Rekordbox 7!
I do code occasionally, but it's more a side thing that might help me make some money along my journey!
I play the guitar, electric and acoustic, the turntable, and I make music digitally too!

### Spoken Languages
I am a native speaker of Danish and English, and I have been learning Japanese for around a year or two,
though I prefer you converse with me in English, thank you.

### Contacting me
If you wish to contact me, I am @dj_razorblade on discord!
Alternatively, email me at djrazorblade.contact@gmail.com

Hope to have fun here on GitHub coding!
