## 📌 About Me

I'm a young self-taught developer from New Zealand. I'm teaching myself how to code so I can create software. I code to create, express, and connect — all while making music and sharing it with the world.

I'm a young developer living in a difficult home environment, where my gender identity isn't accepted. Despite this, I'm committed to learning and growing as a developer.

I currently rely on school computers to code, and I use my phone at home to keep learning. One day, I hope to get myself a MacBook, land a remote job in tech or work in Tallinn, Estonia — A place where I can live freely as myself and express myself through code and music.

Until then, I'm learning every day, building personal projects (which I’ll share when they’re ready), and dreaming big.

## 🌱 Current Goals

- Learn more about full-stack web development, mobile app development, and game development.
- Create my own projects and share them with the world.
- Live in Tallinn, a tech-heavy place where I can live as myself.
- Get a job as a software developer or land a remote job as a developer. Or even just work independently.
- Continue to improve my skills in programming and development.
- Make games for people to enjoy, and software that helps people in their daily lives.
- Creat software with personality, utilising the Frutiger Aero design aesthetic to give users some nostalgia of the Windows 7 and Vista era of the internet.

## 🌍 Spoken Languages

I am a native speaker of English, currently learning Estonian, and I'm also creating my own language called Aerani!

## 📔 Hobbies

I'm a musician, and I also enjoy games in my free time, because they help me learn and gather ideas for software. I hope to one day compete in the Grand Beatbox Battle World League, or the DMC World DJ Championships, or even create games based on them. I also enjoy designing micronations, as they give me a sense of control and help me understand politics.

## 📝 Career

As previously stated, I'm teaching myself all kinds of development, and I aim to work remotely and occasionally livestream some coding sessions to streaming and video-sharing platforms like Twitch and YouTube. I hope to eventually be based in Tallinn or Helsinki, and I want to one day live the life I want to live, as a developer and artist. Who knows, maybe one day I will create my own kernel like Linus Torvalds.

## 🔗 Socials

I would prefer to remain relatively anonymous, if you don't mind.

## 📂 Projects

Nothing to show yet, but I will be working on some projects soon, so stay tuned!

## 🤝 Contributions

If you want to contribute to my projects, feel free to fork them and submit a pull request.
All my projects are open source, so you can use them for your own projects, but please give credit where credit is due.

## Thanks for checking out my README!

I will add more to my GitHub portfolio as I learn, but for a while, it will be quite empty.
Watch out for when I add more projects!
