Hello, こんにちは，Привет, Bonjour, and Hola everyone!  I go by DJ Razorblade, but you may call me Sunaa (other alias)!
I'm an L1 Digital Technology student, learning to use Python3 and HTML5.
In the future, I hope to do work as a Software Engineer/Developer, and a Web designer.

### Hobbies
I do music production as a side project, and I'm also a turntablist (DJ). Though I would prefer to spend my free time learning.

### Spoken Languages
I am a native speaker of English, and I have been learning Japanese for around a year or two,
though I prefer you converse with me in English, thank you.

### Career
I am (as you've likely already read) a producer, DJ, and full time nerd.
