## üìå About Me

I'm a 15-year-old self-taught developer from New Zealand. I'm learning everything from full-stack web development to mobile apps, games, and software. I code to create, express, and connect ‚Äî all while staying grounded in my faith in Islam and my community.

I'm a young Muslim developer living in a difficult home environment, where my religion and gender identity aren't accepted. Despite this, I'm committed to learning and growing as a developer.

I currently rely on school computers to code, and I use my phone at home to keep learning. One day, I hope to get a MacBook, land a remote job in tech or work in Greenland, and move to Qinngorput in the capital of the territory ‚Äî A place where I can live freely as myself and practise my religion without fear.

Until then, I'm learning every day, building personal projects (which I‚Äôll share when they‚Äôre ready), and dreaming big.

## üå± Current Goals

- Learn more about full-stack web development, mobile app development, and game development.
- Create my own projects and share them with the world.
- Live in Qinngorput, Nuuk, Greenland, where I can live as myself and freely follow Islam
- Get a job in Nuuk as a software developer or land a remote job as a developer.
- Continue to improve my skills in programming and development.
- Make games for people to enjoy, and software that helps people in their daily lives.

## üåç Spoken Languages

I am a native speaker of English, currently learning Modern Standard Arabic!

## üìî Hobbies

I'm a beatboxer, and I also enjoy games in my free time, because they help me learn and gather ideas for my own games. I hope to one day compete in the Grand Beatbox Battle World League, or the DMC World DJ Championships, or even create games based on them.

## üìù Career

As previously stated, I'm teaching myself all kinds of development, and I aim to work remotely and occasionally livestream some coding sessions to streaming and video sharing platforms like Twitch and YouTube. I hope to eventually be based in Qinngorput, Nuuk, and I want to one day live the life I want to live, as a niqabi Muslim developer. Who knows, maybe one day I will create my own kernel like Linus Torvalds.
